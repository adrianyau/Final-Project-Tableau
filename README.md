# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The project was to demonstrate visualization techniques with Tableau and show any trends with a data source provided.  The goal is to turn data comparisons into bars, charts, maps, and plots that are easy to present for the general audience to understand a business objective.

## Process
1. I have chosen Option 2. (III) AIRBNB because it would be interesting to map out various listings around the city of New York and find out why is it intriguing for homeowners to rent out their homes and why users are attracted to stay in these places.
2. A map was created to categorize the five (5) boroughs of New York - Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island.
3. A pie chart was created to show the percentage of listings between the boroughs of New York.
4. A bar graph was created to show the total different types of rooms whether private, shared, or fully occupied.
5. Another bar graph was created to show the average price of the number of beds.
6. A line graph was charted to show the review ratings over the time of listings were hosted.
7. A scatterplot was created to show an array of plots between the number of reviews and review ratings.
8. A cluster was analyzed to see if there were any categories between numericals - number of beds, price of listings, number of reviews, and review ratings.

## Results
- 

## Challenges 
- Difficult to plot variables between x-axis and y-axis to make quality comparisons.
- Properly apply enhancements, such as colours, tables, and filters, to convey message to the general audience.
- Come up with the main topic and lead with a story to capture the attention of the audience.

## Future Goals
- Apply advanced Tableau skills, such as animations.
- Use of external URL links on Dashboard to supplement additional information on Airbnb.
