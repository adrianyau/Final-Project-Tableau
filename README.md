# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The project was to demonstrate visualization techniques with Tableau and show any trends with a data source provided.  The goal is to turn data comparisons into bars, charts, maps, and plots that are easy to present for the general audience to understand a business objective.

## Process
1. I have chosen Option 2. (III) AIRBNB because it would be interesting to map out various listings around the city of New York and find out something interesting with the type of properties and prices to stay at any of these location.
2. The 'airbnb.xlsx' file was uploaded to the 'Data Source' in Tableau.
3. The data was analyzed between measures (e.g., zipcodes, neighborhood, property types, and room types) versus dimensions (e.g., number of beds, prices, number of reviews, and review ratings).
4. A map was created to categorize the five (5) boroughs of New York by color - Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island.
5. A pie chart was created to show the percentage of listings between the boroughs of New York.
6. A bar graph was created to show the total different types of rooms whether private, shared, or fully occupied.
7. Another bar graph was created to show the average price of the number of beds.
8. A line graph was charted to show the review ratings over the time of listings were hosted.
9. Another line graph was charated to show the number of listings over the time of listings hosted.
10. A scatterplot was created to show an array of plots between the number of reviews and review ratings.
11. A cluster was analyzed to see if there were any categories between numericals - number of beds, price of listings, number of reviews, and review ratings.
12. A box plot was create to detect any outliers.

## Results
- Manhattan and Brooklyn are the most popular boroughs given the denser urban population and higher Airbnb listings with respect to apartments.  Occupation of the entire place is the predominant form of space given the crowdedness and urban design of the city.
- The more beds, the more prices to spend, however, they appear to be still cheaper than hotels by average.
- Apartments are the most common property type in New York.  Perhaps sub-letting is popular with tenants to give financial and living flexibility without long-term commitments.
- Guests prefer entire place, so they maintain full privacy without sharing amenities with other guests.
- With respect to outliers, there are a couple of 2-bedroom apartments for the entire place that cost in the thousands.  However, the same costs, but for more guests (+5 beds) and for the entire house may not be abnormal for large groups.

## Challenges 
- Difficult to plot variables between x-axis and y-axis to make direct quality comparisons.
- Properly apply enhancements, such as colours, tables, and filters, to convey message to the general audience.
- Come up with the main topic and lead with a story to capture the attention of the audience.

## Future Goals
- Apply advanced Tableau skills, such as animations, to incorporate into Dashboard and Stories.
